Name: Arvel Vincent Cavitt
Project Title: Fitness Tracker --> similar to chore tracker
GitHub Link: https://github.com/ArvelCavitt/fitness_tracker.git

Solo Proposal:

    The main reason why i connect this project with the Chore Tracker example is because
it will perform pretty similar the main difference is that it will be about work outs
you can do at home/gym/outdoors that you can keep track of.
    maybe I can set it up as a challenge for friends to push each other  to compete in a friendly competition.

*First step would include a Login/Registration
*Anyone who is logged in can see the different type of workouts that is displayed
and will be removed if someone already completed it before you.
